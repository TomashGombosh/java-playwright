/**
 * This package contains services that are used to interact with the API, database, or other external services.
 * <p>
 * Each service class should contain methods that represent actions that can be performed on the service.
 * For example, a user service class might contain a method to create a new user.
 * Service classes should not contain assertions, as those should be handled in the test classes or steps
 * Service classes should be used to encapsulate the logic of the service, making it easier to maintain and update.
