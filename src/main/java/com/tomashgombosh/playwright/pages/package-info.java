/**
 * This package contains classes that represent pages of the application.
 * <p>
 *     Each page class should contain methods that represent actions that can be performed on the page.
 *     For example, a login page class might contain a method to log in with a given username and password.
 *     Page classes should not contain assertions, as those should be handled in the test classes or steps
 *     Page classes should also not contain any Playwright code, as that should be handled in the test classes.
 *     Page classes should be used to encapsulate the logic of the application, making it easier to maintain and update.
 *     Page classes should be used to represent the different pages of the application, making it easier to navigate between them.
 * </p>
