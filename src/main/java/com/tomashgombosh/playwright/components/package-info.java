/**
 * This package contains classes that represent components of the application.
 * <p>
 *     Each component class should contain methods that represent actions that can be performed on the component.
 *     For example, a navigation component class might contain a method to navigate to a specific page.
 *     Component classes should not contain assertions, as those should be handled in the test classes or steps
 *     Component classes should also not contain any Playwright code, as that should be handled in the test classes.
 *     Component classes should be used to encapsulate the logic of the application, making it easier to maintain and update.
 *     Component classes should be used to represent the different components of the application, making it easier to interact with them.
 * </p>
